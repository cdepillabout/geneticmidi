* For the player panel, it would be nice to add a pause button.  Also, it would be nice
  to add a slider to show how far along the song is.

* In PopulationListPanel.java, there is a weird bug where the bottom of the table is not
  visible.  I need to fix this.

* In PopulationListPanel.java, I should change the sort order so it is in decreasing 
  order.  That is, when I sort by fitness, the highest fitness ones should be at
  the top.

* Make PopulationListPanel.java multi-threaded.  So, when the evolve button is clicked,
  you don't have to wait until all the evolutions are finished.

* In PopulationViewer.java, it would be nice to add a file dialog to open the midi file
  we want to evolve into.  

* Write more JUnit tests, especially for the functions from Note.java and MidiHelper.java

* Change the fitness function so that it just calculates the fitness based
  on binary strings from the vector of Notes.

* Change the project to work with ArrayLists instead of Vectors.  ArrayLists are not
  synchronized, so they don't work well with multiple threads.
