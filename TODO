* In MidiHelper.java, isNoteOnMessage() and isNoteOffMessage() don't take into account
  the fact that if a note on message has a velocity of zero, it is considered a note
  off message.

* Strewn throughout the code, I am always modeling my MidiIndividuals off of track 0 from
  the ideal sequence.  I should change this to model them off of what ever track they came
  from.  I will probably have to add a field to Midi Individual to say what number track it
  came from.

* For the player panel, it would be nice to add a pause button.  Also, it would be nice
  to add a slider to show how far along the song is.

* In PopulationListPanel.java, there is a weird bug where the bottom of the table is not
  visible.  I need to fix this.

* In PopulationListPanel.java, I should change the sort order so it is in decreasing 
  order.  That is, when I sort by fitness, the highest fitness ones should be at
  the top.

* Make PopulationListPanel.java multi-threaded.  So, when the evolve button is clicked,
  you don't have to wait until all the evolutions are finished.

* In PopulationViewer.java, it would be nice to add a file dialog to open the midi file
  we want to evolve into.  

* It would be nice to make IdealSequence.java load a midi file and evolve into it.

* It would be nice to make MidiIndividual represent the whole midi file and not just
  one track from ideal sequence.

* Make MidiIndividual add the Meta Events, program events, controller events, etc., to 
  the beginning of the MidiIndividual track.

* Write more JUnit tests, especially for the functions from MidiHelper.java and Note.java
